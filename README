Net-Autoconfig version 1.12.2
===========================

This is a module to allow the bulk upgrade and configuration
of many network devices (switches, routers, probably firewalls)
of any vendor (HP, Cisco, ...) in an automated fasion.  It uses
templates and device configuration files for scriptable, consistent
configurations.  It automatically discovers the vendor and model and does
configrurations based on: 1) the hostname of the device, 2) the specific model,
3) the model class, or 4) the basic vendor + device type.  User definable
variables in the device file can be interpolated in the template commands
at run-time, per device.  Logs using a syslog style.  It can be
setup to log to the standard log locations (e.g. /var/log/),
to the screen, or to a file in the current working directory.
Configures devices in parallel (default 128, max 256) for quick
upgrades and deployments.
